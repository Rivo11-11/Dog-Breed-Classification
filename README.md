# Dog Breed Identification

This repository contains a complete pipeline for identifying dog breeds from images using deep learning techniques. The project uses transfer learning with the InceptionV3 model to classify images into different dog breeds.

## Data Exploration & Analysis

The dataset consists of images labeled with various dog breeds. The exploration includes:
- Analyzing the distribution of breeds.
- Visualizing a subset of images to understand the data.
- Encoding breed labels for model training.

The dataset is divided into training and test directories with images in JPEG format. Key visualizations include:
- Distribution of top 10 and least 10 breeds.
- Sample images from both training and test sets.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves:
- Loading and resizing images to a standard size (224x224 pixels).
- Label encoding the breed names.
- One-hot encoding the labels for model training.

The `load_data` function processes images and labels, preparing them for model training and validation.

## Model Training

The model training involves:
- Creating a data augmentation pipeline using `ImageDataGenerator` to improve model generalization.
- Training a deep learning model based on the InceptionV3 architecture with transfer learning.

The training process includes:
- Configuring and compiling the model.
- Using data augmentation to improve performance.
- Monitoring training and validation loss and accuracy using callbacks.

## Evaluation & Prediction

After training, the model is evaluated on a validation set and predictions are generated for test images. Key steps include:
- Loading and preprocessing test images.
- Generating predictions using the trained model.
- Displaying some predictions along with the images.

## Submission

A CSV file is created for submission, containing the image IDs and predicted breed probabilities. This file is formatted according to the competition requirements.

The submission CSV is generated using the `create_submission_csv` function, which saves the predictions to `submission.csv`.
